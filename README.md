This is a project part of CS50AI. I have only written the 3 main functiions: joint_probability, update, normalize. 
This program calculates the probabilities of each person in a family having a specific genetic trait (in the course, it is the GJB2 gene) given a csv file for the family like the ones in the data folder by considering all possible gene and trait configurations, 
then accumulating and normalizing these probabilities based on given genetic and trait data. A Bayesian network was used to model the idea that a child gene is dependant on parents gene.
